*Easily fix the formatting of conversations copied from Slack*

Have you ever tried to copy a Slack conversation from a private message to a channel, or vice versa, or anywhere at all?  
Well, I have. And let me tell you: it wasn't great.

Check out [chrmcg.github.io/slack-copy](http://chrmcg.github.io/slack-copy) for a barely livable solution to this very serious problem.

If it doesn't work the way you'd hoped, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/chrmcg/slack-copy/issues/new)!
